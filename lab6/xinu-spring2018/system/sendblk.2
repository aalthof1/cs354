NAME
	sendblk - Blocking system message send operation

SYNOPSIS
	#include <xinu.h>

	syscall sendblk(pid32 pid, umsg32 msg);

DESCRIPTION
	The sendblk() and receive() system calls are used, respectively,
	to  send  messages  to,  and  receive  messages from, a process'
	message queue.

sendblk()
	The  sendblk()  system  call  sends  a  message  to  the process
	specified  by  its process id pid. If the receiving process does
	not  have  a  message  in  its  prmsg field, the message is sent
	directly  to  the  process.  If  the process does already have a 
	message,   the   message  is  stored  in  the  sending  process' 
	sendblkmsg  field,  and  the  sending  processes pid is enqueued
	to  the  receiving  process'  sendqueue queue and its rcpblkflag
	is updated to indicate there are processes blocking to send.

	Upon  successful completion the receiving process' process table
	entry is updated as follows:

		rcpblkflag is set to 1 if the sendqueue is not empty

		sendqueue is updated to hold the pid of the sending
		process if necessary

		prhasmsg is set to 1 if the process did not previously
		have a message

		prmsg is updated to hold the message if it did not
		previously have a message

	Upon  successful  completion  the sending process' process table
	entry is updated as follows if blocking is necessary:

		sendblkflag is set to 1

		sendblkmsg is set to the message waiting to be sent

		sendblkrcp is the process id of the receiving process

		prstate is set to PR_SNDBLK

RETURN VALUE
	On failure sendblk() returns -1, otherwise it returns 0
