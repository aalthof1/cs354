NAME
	receive - Blocking system message receive operation

SYNOPSIS
	#include <xinu.h>

	syscall sendblk();

DESCRIPTION
	The sendblk() and receive() system calls are used, respectively,
	to  send  messages  to,  and  receive  messages from, a process'
	message queue.

receive()
	The  receive()  system  call removes the message from it's prmsg
	process  table  field.  If  there  are  entries  in the process'
	sendqueue  queue,  the oldest item is removed and placed and the
	sendblkmsg  of  the corresponding pid is placed in the receiving
	process'  prmsg field. If there is no message in the prmsg field
	the calling process blocks until a message is received.

	Upon  successful completion the receiving process' process table
	entry is updated as follows:

		sendqueue is updated to remove the oldest entry if
		necessary

		rcpblkflag is set to 0 if the sendqueue is empty

		prhasmsg is set to 0 if the process no longer has a 
		message

		prmsg is updated to hold the message of the sendqueue
		entry's sendblkmsg if necessary

	Upon  successful  completion  the sending process' process table
	entry is updated as follows if blocking was necessary:

		sendblkflag is set to 0

		prstate is set to PR_READY

RETURN VALUE
	On  failure  receive()  returns  -1,  otherwise  it  returns the
	message received.
